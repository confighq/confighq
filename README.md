# configHQ

**configHQ** is a centralized configuration platform, which can be used as a flexible way to configure applications at runtime. Some suggested use cases: Product configurations/settings with exception handling, one/region based configurations, feature flagging, whitelisting of internal/external services, high performance key-value store, implementation of peer review process for adding, updating or removing configurations.

**configHQ** fits perfectly in a microservice architecture, and can be run as a microservice itself.



## How to use
**configHQ** can be managed through a user-friendly, web-based admin interface.

The core of the user interface is a query builder, which is used for easy setup of configuration rules or value storage.
